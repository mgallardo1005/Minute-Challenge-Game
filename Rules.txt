The Minute Challenge Game is a combination of timed mental, physical and social exercises that will get you thinking, moving and having fun.
Complete your challenge before the time runs out!

To get started:

-The game can be played with 4 to 10 players. The more, the merrier.
-One person will be a designated score keeper, so get a pen and paper, chalk board, pizza box and a marker, whatever you can use to keep a tally.
-2 ways to begin play: 
	The person who had the last birthday goes first and play goes to his or her left around the room
	Allow the game to choose randomly
	Everyone picks a different number from 1 to the max number of players, (for 8 players everyone chooses a different number between 1 and 8) and the game will randomly decide who goes first and play goes to the left.
-Some challenges require basic household items to use as props such as a deck of playing cards, small snacks like M&Ms or marshmellows, or a sheet of paper. If you do not have the required items, simply skip these challenges.

Rules of the game:

-Upon each players turn, player will select from 1 of 3 categories. Click on the "Get Challenge" button of your chosen category to get your challenge.
-Read your challenge and gather any necessary item(s) required to complete it. When you are ready, click "Start" to begin.
-Players will be given exactly one minute to complete their challenge.
-If successful, player gets a point. Next player then goes.
-First player to reach a designated amount of points wins. For short games, play to 5 points; for longer games, play to 15.

*****Social Challenges*****

-Social challenges work differently that Mental or Physical.
-If player chooses a Social Challenge, he or she must select a player to complete the challenge with BEFORE clicking to get their challenge. Choose wisely!
-If the two players complete the challenge, the person who's turn it is has two options:
	He or she can opt to recieve a point along with their partner receiving a point.
	He or she may choose to deduct a point from the the person with the most points instead of anyone receiving a point.
-The person who was selected as a partner does not lose his or her turn.

Strategy is always necessary. Good Luck!
