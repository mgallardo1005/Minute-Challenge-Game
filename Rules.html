    <br>
    
    <p class='intro'>The Minute Challenge Game is a combination of timed mental, physical and social exercises that will get you thinking, moving and having fun.
Complete your challenge before the time runs out!</p>
    <br>
    
    <h1 class="heading">To get started:</h1>
    <div class="info">
    <p>The game can be played with 4 to 10 players. The more, the merrier.</p>
    <p>One person will be a designated score keeper, so get a pen and paper, chalk board, pizza box and a marker, whatever you can use to keep a tally.</p>
    <p>2 ways to begin play:</p>
      <div class="indent">
	    <p>-The person who had the last birthday goes first and play goes to his or her left around the room</p>
	    <p>-Allow the game to choose randomly.</p>
      </div>
    <p>Some challenges require basic household items to use as props such as a deck of playing cards, small snacks like M&Ms or marshmellows, or a sheet of paper. If you do not have the required items, simply skip these challenges.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    
    <h1 class="heading">Rules of the game:</h1>
    <div class="info">

    <h1 class="heading">***** Social Challenges *****</h1>
    <div class="info">
    <p>Social challenges work differently that Mental or Physical challenges and are designed to get players engaging with one another and apply a level of strategy to the game.</p>

      <div class="indent">
	    <p>He or she can opt to recieve a point along with their partner receiving a point.</p>
	    <p>He or she may choose to deduct a point from the the person with the most points instead of anyone receiving a point.</p>
      </div>
    <p>The person who was selected as a partner does not lose his or her turn.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
